## Blindness Detection

This notebook contains the code for the Blindness Detection. The goal of this project is to predict the severity of [diabetic retinopathy](https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/diabetic-retinopathy) in images. The severity is an integer between 0 and 4, where 0 indicates no diabetic retinopathy and 4 indicates the highest severity of diabetic retinopathy.

- class 0 = No DR
- class 1 = Mild
- class 2 = Moderate
- class 3 = Severe
- class 4 = Proliferative DR

The dataset is from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benjaminwarner/resized-2015-2019-blindness-detection-images).
